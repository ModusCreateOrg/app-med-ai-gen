- Use strict null checks
- Prefer interface over type when possible
- Utilize type guards and assertions for runtime type checking
- Implement proper type inference to reduce explicit type annotations
- Prefer using nullish coalescing operator (`??`) instead of a logical or (`||`), as it is a safer operator.
